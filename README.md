# NeuroPlan 🧠✨  
EEG-Inspired Personalized Learning Planner  

NeuroPlan is an AI-assisted study planning interface designed to optimize cognitive performance using behavioral productivity signals (task completion, timing patterns) and future EEG integration.

This repository contains the **Light Mode (behavior-only)** version built with Next.js.

## 🚀 Features

- Top-3 daily priority system  
- Task scheduling with duration & cognitive load  
- Efficiency tracking dashboard  
- Behavioral productivity analytics  
- Future EEG integration ready

## 🧠 Concept

NeuroPlan models study performance as a function of:

- task duration patterns  
- completion consistency  
- cognitive load estimation  
- temporal productivity rhythms  

Light Mode uses behavioral data only.  
EEG Mode (future) will integrate Muse signals.
